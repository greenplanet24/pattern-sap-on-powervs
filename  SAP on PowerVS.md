# Overview

> The objective of this document is to provide an IBM Solution Design
> for the deployment of SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS) to:

-   Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard IBM
    Cloud deployment architecture reference solution for SAP on IBM
    PowerVS enterprise-class deployments following the [IBM Architecture
    Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro).

-   Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design,
    with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale
    for cloud component selection for a secure, resilient SAP on PowerVS
    deployment.

-   Ensure requirements can be met from performance, system availability
    and security prespectives .

> This is a [baseline]{.underline} solution pattern containing the
> design and architecture decisions for an SAP deployment on IBM Cloud
> Power Virtual Server to meet common requirements. Actual client
> solutions will depend on specific client needs. This document does not
> cover SAP configuration and SAP component deployment scenarios, it is
> limited to IBM cloud infrastructure options to support SAP workloads.
>
> It describes the deployment of SAP Business Applications Running on
> SAP NetWeaver, SAP HANA or SAP AnyDB and other SAP products using
> other technologies (SAP Content Server, or newer applications such as
> SAP Data Intelligence).

IBM Cloud SAP-Certified Infrastructure provides the flexibility to run
SAP workloads in the IBM Cloud and the ability quickly address issues
such as:

-   Moving SAP workloads to the cloud

-   Rapidly expanding or contracting capacity

-   Supplementing an existing private cloud architecture

Enterprise-class, mission critical workloads need to be resilient and
provide disaster recovery (DR) capabilities and high availability (HA).
This pattern illustrates a Single-Zone, Multi-Region design deployed to
IBM Power Virtual Server, which can provide both DR and HA to provide
99.95 availability for an SAP NetWeaver/HANA or SAP NetWeaver/AnyDB
solution to meet typical customer requirements.

The following documentation provides design considerations and
architecture decisions for deploying the IBM Cloud resources to support
SAP existing (migration) or new workloads, including:

-   SAP Business Applications such as SAP S/4HANA or SAP BW/4HANA

-   SAP Technical Applications such SAP HANA database server and SAP
    NetWeaver application server

# Reference architecture

## Architecture diagrams

Figure 1 provides a high-level summary of the Use Case, a SAP
Single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud PowerVS. The Primary
Region supports Production workloads on PowerVS. The Secondary Region
supports non-Production and Disaster Recovery workloads should the
customer have DR requirements. The components deployed to the Edge VPC
provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud
workloads.

1.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Link with
    VPN access for MSPs.

2.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security
    functions.

3.  Transit Gateway to Power Virtual Server hosting the SAP application
    and database(s)

4.  Public connectivity also routes through Cloud Internet Services
    (CIS) which can provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services,
    then routes to the edge VPC

5.  Global Transit Gateway connecting the PowerVS environment across
    regions to facilitate replication for DR purposes.

Architecture Description

1.  Two separate IBM Cloud regions, one containing production, the other
    containing both non-production and DR.

2.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Links to
    each region with VPN access for MSPs.

3.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security
    functions. For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic
    will route through the Edge VPC. It contains an sFTP server, Bastion
    host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions and the
    SAP router and Web Dispatcher.

4.  The Edge VPC is connected to PowerVS through a local Transit Gateway
    and hosts the SAP application and database(s).

5.  Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet services which can
    provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to
    the edge VPC

6.  PowerVS contains SAP Application components hosted on redundant SAP
    certified LPARS in an [SAP
    Scale-out](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2)
    environment.

7.  SAP HANA is hosted on separate SAP certified LPARs in the same zone,
    using local Tier 1 storage.

8.  Virtual Private endpoints are used to provide connectivity to cloud
    native services

9.  Global Transit Gateway connecting PowerVS across regions for data
    replication purposes between the two regions.

10. Multiple LPARs are used to provide 99.95% availability within a zone

11. Bare Metals in classic to provide backups using IBM Storage Protect

## Design Scope

Design decisions that need to be considered for an end-2-end SAP on
PowerVS deployment and which are covered in this accelerator include:

-   **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual Servers

-   **Storage:** Primary, Backup, and Archive

-   **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation
    and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing

-   **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure
    and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response

-   **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High
    Availability

-   **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting,
    Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the
Architecture
Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro),
provides a consistent approach to designing cloud solutions by
addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of \"aspects\" and
\"domains\", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need
to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide
to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure the
applicable requirements for each \"aspect\" and \"domain\" have been
considered. Figure 3 below shows the domains that are covered in this
solution.

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture
Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)
is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for
which architecture decisions need to be made based on customer
requirements. The following sections contain the considerations, and
architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are in scope for
this solution pattern.

## 

## Compute design

Power Virtual Servers are available with flexible hardware
configurations on both Power S922 and E980. It is permitted to define a
custom size of the IBM Power Virtual Server to use for SAP NetWeaver, in
accordance with existing SAP NetWeaver or SAP AnyDB for IBM Power
Systems best practices and guidance from SAP.

The Flexibility of IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers hardware capability
includes:

-   Cores (CPU)

-   Memory (RAM)

-   Data volume size

-   Data volume type / performance tier

-   Network interfaces

-   PowerVM Host Pinning Policy (soft or hard)

-   PowerVM Host CPU Binding (dedicated or shared)

PowerVS custom profiles are for nonproduct development for testing or
development use only. Custom, non-SAP Certified profiles aren\'t
intended for production deployments and aren\'t supported or certified
for SAP production. Custom profiles should not be used to go from a
nonproduction environment to a production environment.

There are multiple SAP Certified Power Virtual Sever profiles certified
by SAP:

> NetWeaver PowerVS profiles:
>
> [IBM Power Virtual Server certified profiles for SAP
> NetWeaver](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-nw-iaas-offerings-profiles-power-vs)
>
> HANA PowerVS profiles:
>
> [IBM Power Virtual Server certified profiles for SAP
> HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-power-vs)

For sizing information see [Sizing process for SAP
Systems](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sizing&interface=ui)

For a distributed SAP installation, it is best to have all nodes in the
same location (Availability Zone or Datacenter). Deviation from this
setup can cause latency and timeouts, which render your SAP system
unresponsive. Due to this, SAP does not support the application layer
and database to be deployed across different zones or COLOs, therefore
the application and database layers must exist in the same availability
zone or COLO.

Databases typically experience growth over time so database size and
expected data growth rates should be taken into consideration when
planning database deployments.

SAP AnyDB

AnyDB refers to any non-HANA, SAP supported database. SAP supports: IBM
DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP Max DB, SAP ASE and SAP IQ.

Deploying SAP AnyDB on IBM PowerVS is similar to deployments with
infrastructure with on-premises data centers. You can use the
information that is provided from SAP and the RDBMS providers. The
following links contain design considerations for each database:

[IBM DB2](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-anydb-ibm-db2)

[SAP Max DB](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-anydb-sap-maxdb)

[SAP ASE](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-anydb-sap-ase)

[SAP IQ](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-anydb-sap-iq)

Oracle RAC for high availability and Oracle Dataguard for disaster
recovery can be deployed to PowerVS as an AnyDB option. Best practices
and guidance for both can be found at the following links:

[Oracle RAC on
PowerVS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/pattern-oracle-rac-on-powervs?topic=pattern-oracle-rac-on-powervs-overview)

[Oracle Disaster Recovery using Data
Guard](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/pattern-oracle-disaster-recovery-on-powervs?topic=pattern-oracle-disaster-recovery-on-powervs-Oracle-dr-ibm-pvs#oracle-data-guard)

## Storage design

SAP solutions will want to ensure there is enough available storage to
accommodate the existing environment and allow for additional data
growth for primary, backup and archive storage. You will need to choose
the appropriate SAP Certified profile to meet primary storage and growth
requirements for workloads.

The storage tiers in Power Systems Virtual Server are based on I/O
operations per second (IOPS). It means that the performance of your
storage volumes is limited to the maximum number of IOPS based on volume
size and storage tier.

For each Power Systems Virtual Server instance, you must select a Flash
storage from IBM FS9000 series devices [storage
tiers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-about-virtual-server#storage-tiers):
Tier 1 is currently set to 10 IOPS/GB or Tier 3 is currently set to 3
IOPS/GB.

When planning an SAP deployment, IOPS and its effect on latency needs to
also be considered. 100 GB PowerVS Tier 3 storage volume can receive up
to 300 IOPs, and a 100 GB Tier 1 storage volume can receive up to 1000
IOPS. After the IOPS limit is reached for the storage volume, the I/O
latency increases.

Storage tiers differ and Storage tiers cannot be mixed.

For SAP HANA, only Tier 1 storage is supported and is required.

For SAP NetWeaver, both Tier 1 and Tier 3 are supported.

For SAP NetWeaver and SAP AnyDB databases (such as IBM Db2 or Oracle
DB), Tier 1 (NVMe) is recommended but Tier 3 (SSD) can be used.
Typically, Tier 3 storage tier is not suitable for production workloads.
When choosing a storage tier, ensure that you consider not just the
average I/O load, but more importantly the peak IOPS of your storage
workload.

Client is responsible for backing up data on for PowerVS FlashSystem
FS9000 storage

[Other Storage
Considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-storage-design-considerations)

## Network design

Networking is a key aspect of any cloud deployment that should not be
overlooked. The network design should consider enterprise connectivity,
latency, throughput, resiliency, and security requirements.

For security purposes, it is recommended to isolate production from
non-production workloads as a best practice. In addition, it's also a
best practice to isolate by application tiers (e.g. application vs.
database). PowerVS enables the creation of logical isolation across
separate LPARs.

To provide isolation and centralize advanced security functions, the
network design follows "Hub and spoke" VPC model. The Edge VPC serves as
the hub for which all ingress and egress traffic flows. The Edge is a
virtual network (VPC) that acts as a central point of connectivity to
on-premises network and all other VPC and PowerVS environments. PowerVS
is connected to the Edge ("Hub") via a Transit Gateway which allows
traffic routing between each of the PowerVS, VPC and classic
environments in the IBM Cloud account.

Enterprise connectivity is needed to connect the SAP environment to the
client data center(s). IBM Cloud Direct Link is typically used for this
connectivity and if redundancy is needed, two direct links can be used
in a resilient design.

A separate Management VPC (not illustrated) can be deployed into
multiple regions if needed, to host management infrastructure and
services also connected to the Edge and PowerVS through Transit Gateway.

# For a list of all Networking Considerations, see [networking design considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-networking-design-considerations).

#  

## Security design

Security should be applied at all layers of the solution for defense in
depth depending on requirements, for example at the network edge, VPCs,
and at every compute instance as well as at the application and database
layers. In addition, data should be protected both in transit and at
rest according to data classification and controls should be in place to
eliminate the need for direct access to the environment(s), and when
direct access is needed, all access should be logged and monitored.

It is a best practice to isolate, secure, manage and monitor all ingress
and egress traffic to the environment and to centralize these functions
in a hub and spoke model through an Edge VPC. As a result, it's
recommended that security and isolation is established using a
combination of Security Groups (SG), Network Access Control Lists (NACL)
and routing/FW rules defined in the Edge VPC. This is in addition to the
cloud account level protection provided in IBM Cloud Identity Services.

Implementation of firewall(s) in the Transit/Edge can secure and route
traffic to the IBM Cloud environment as well as from the Customer
network.

Enable logging to facilitate the firewall activity analysis if needed to
meet client security IPS/IDS requirements.

All traffic, both public and private, should route through the
Edge/Transit VPC for routing, isolation, and logging.

To restrict, log and monitor administrative access to the environment, a
bastion (jump) host is recommended in the Edge VPC for all
administrative access. In addition, all Bastion access and activity
should be logged and monitored through Privileged Access Management
(PAM) services.

Security is a shared responsibility between cloud provider and customer
at both the infrastructure and application layers.

## Resiliency design

Resiliency is the ability of a workload to meet a specific target
Service Level Objective (SLO), Service Level Availability (SLA) or
recover from a service disruption and still meet the required SLA.
Resiliency needs to be considered at both the infrastructure and
application layers across the entire solution.

A resilient design may include Disaster Recovery (DR) and High
Availability (HA) depending on SLA requirements and they are two
different things.

Disaster Recovery is the infrastructure, application layers and
accompanying set of policies and procedures to enable the recovery or
continuation of vital technology infrastructure and applications
following a natural or human-induced disaster.

High Availability is the resource availability in a solution throughout
the stack, built in by design, to withstand individual component
failures in the system.

Both DR and HA can be enabled using several technologies and approaches
which depends on the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time
Objective (RTO) and SLA requirements.

The table below shows a comparison of the different deployment options.

1.  Based on Cloud infrastructure
    [SLA.](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-9268&lc=en#detail-document)
    Does not represent application availability

2.  3 or more instances in separate Availability Zones

As mentioned in the Compute section, SAP does not support the
application layer and database to be deployed across different zones;
the application and database layers must exist in the same availability
zone or COLO. Therefore, the highest availability that can be supported
is 99.95%

# For more information on Resiliency on IBM Cloud, see [High Availability and Resiliency on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ha-infrastructure?topic=ha-infrastructure-landing-about-ha-dr-backup).

Depending on requirements and design, an SAP deployment on IBM cloud can
support 99.95% availability. Unfortunately, SAP does not certify
solutions that span multiple zones, so resiliency is deployed to a
single zone with multiple server instances in the same zone.

The IBM Cloud application load balancer along with SAP Web Dispatcher
spreads client requests or loads across 2 or more server instances for
improved resiliency and improved performance. In addition, IBM Cloud
load balancers do health checks to ensure that only \"healthy\" virtual
server instances receive client requests.

IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers are designed by hardened configuration
within single data center to provide 99.95% SLA. For more details, refer
to [Service Level Agreements for IBM
Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-9268&lc=en#detail-document).

To increase availability for SAP systems on IBM Power Systems Virtual
servers, High Availability instances can be deployed within the same
data center with "Different Server" [placement
group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-placement-groups),
and Disaster Recovery systems can be deployed in a different region.

To maximize investment on DR infrastructure so DR infrastructure is not
idle, it's recommended to have cross-region passive DR deployed on
reduced-size VMs. To reserve the capacity for DR systems, [Shared
Processor
Pool](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/power9?topic=systems-managing-shared-processor-pools)
can be setup with a small fee.

Alternative cost optimized DR systems may be configured so that DR
systems share the same infrastructure with Non-Production systems, if
segmentation/compliance/licensing/Non-Production system availability and
other client requirements allow.

The IBM Cloud environment does not support any preconfigured
high-availability (HA) scenarios for SAP. However, HA scenarios can be
configured based on the HA extension for the operating system. HA
extensions are created by adding the required hardware and the required
software components to SAP landscapes.

[Here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2)
is an overview of a single-zone resilient SAP Scale-out deployment.

A combination of SAP Native Database Backup tools is used to deliver the
resiliency services such as:

-   DBACOCKPIT

-   HANACOCKPIT

-   Backint for SAP Database backups

To support database recovery for points in time going back at least one
month, a daily database backup is required, along with redo log backups
every 15 minutes.

-   For long-term recovery of data, an additional monthly backup is
    suggested with a one-year data retention or as determined by the
    customer.

-   The daily log backup frequency for production DB should be less than
    or equal to the customer desired RPO parameter for their Business
    Continuity Plan

-   Production System Monthly full retained for 60 days. Daily Full
    retained for 1 week. Daily incremental retained for 60 days. Weekly
    Full retained for 30 days.

-   Non-Productions System Monthly full retained for 60 days. Weekly
    Full retained for 14 days week. Daily incremental retained for 60
    days.

Consider the largest DB size for full backups with room for addition
growth. Recommend complementing the backup solution with Daily snapshots
for production.

## Migration design

There are several migration scenarios, the most straight-forward being a
direct "lift-and-shift" (homogeneous) where the Infrastructure and SAP
versions remain the same, for example on-prem SAP NetWeaver ABAP 7.0
running on VMWare to the same environment on cloud. Migration from
on-prem to another infrastructure platform or SAP version
(heterogeneous) can become more complex, especially when combined with a
DB conversion or application server upgrade.

# For a list of migration options and tools, see [Moving SAP Workloads](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-faq-moving-sap-workloads#faq-moving-sap-workloads-overview).

There are two types of SAP migration categories:

Homogeneous - Target has the same OS and software versions as the source

Heterogeneous - Target has a different OS, software or database type or
version than the source

The following tables summarize various approaches for a homogeneous and
heterogeneous migration; all dependent on client environment(s) and
preferences.
