Figure 1 provides a high-level summary of the Use Case, a SAP
Single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud PowerVS. The Primary
Region supports Production workloads on PowerVS. The Secondary Region
supports non-Production and Disaster Recovery workloads should the
customer have DR requirements. The components deployed to the Edge VPC
provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud
workloads.

1.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Link with
    VPN access for MSPs.

2.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security
    functions.

3.  Transit Gateway to Power Virtual Server hosting the SAP application
    and database(s)

4.  Public connectivity also routes through Cloud Internet Services
    (CIS) which can provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services,
    then routes to the edge VPC

5.  Global Transit Gateway connecting the PowerVS environment across
    regions to facilitate replication for DR purposes.

Figure 2 illustrates a detailed network and component architecture for a
single-zone, multi-region deployment to facilitate disaster recovery.

Architecture Description

1.  Two separate IBM Cloud regions, one containing production, the other
    containing both non-production and DR.

2.  Client network connectivity is accomplished through Direct Links to
    each region with VPN access for MSPs.

3.  An Edge VPC is deployed which contains routing and security
    functions. For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic
    will route through the Edge VPC. It contains an sFTP server, Bastion
    host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions and the
    SAP router and Web Dispatcher.

4.  The Edge VPC is connected to PowerVS through a local Transit Gateway
    and hosts the SAP application and database(s).

5.  Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet services which can
    provide load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to
    the edge VPC

6.  PowerVS contains SAP Application components hosted on redundant SAP
    certified LPARS in an [SAP
    Scale-out](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-refarch-hana-scaleout#network-layout-for-scale-out-configurations-2)
    environment.

7.  SAP HANA is hosted on separate SAP certified LPARs in the same zone,
    using local Tier 1 storage.

8.  Virtual Private endpoints are used to provide connectivity to cloud
    native services

9.  Global Transit Gateway connecting PowerVS across regions for data
    replication purposes between the two regions.

10. Multiple LPARs are used to provide 99.95% availability within a zone

11. Bare Metals in classic to provide backups using IBM Storage Protect


## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Design decisions that need to be considered for an end-2-end SAP on
PowerVS deployment and which are covered in this accelerator include:

-   **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual Servers

-   **Storage:** Primary, Backup, and Archive

-   **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation
    and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing

-   **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure
    and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response

-   **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High
    Availability

-   **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting,
    Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the
Architecture
Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro),
provides a consistent approach to designing cloud solutions by
addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of \"aspects\" and
\"domains\", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need
to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide
to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure the
applicable requirements for each \"aspect\" and \"domain\" have been
considered. Figure 3 below shows the domains that are covered in this
solution.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following  represents a [baseline]{.underline} set of requirements
which we believe are applicable to most clients and critical to a
successful SAP deployment.

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture
Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)
is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for
which architecture decisions need to be made based on customer
requirements. The following sections contain the considerations, and
architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are in scope for
this solution pattern.
