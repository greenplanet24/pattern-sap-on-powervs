# SAP on Power Virtual Server
{: #sap-on-powervs}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

The primary region supports Production workloads on Power Virtual Server. The secondary region supports nonproduction and disaster recovery workloads should the customer have DR requirements. The components deployed to the Edge VPC provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud workloads.

This is a baseline solution pattern containing the design and architecture decisions for an SAP deployment on IBM Cloud Power Virtual Server to meet the common requirements provided in prior sections. Actual client solutions will depend on specific client requirements.

Figure 1 illustrates a high-level summary of the Use Case, an SAP Single-zone, multi-region deployment on IBM Cloud PowerVS.  The Primary Region supports Production workloads on PowerVS. The Secondary Region supports non-Production and Disaster Recovery workloads should the customer have DR requirements. The components deployed to the VPC Landing Zone provide security functions and resource isolation to the IBM Cloud workloads.

1. Client network connectivity from on-premises is accomplished through Direct Link access. Management network connectivity is accomplished through site-to-site VPN.

2. A VPC Landing Zone (Edge VPC) is deployed which contains routing and security functions and optional management components for backup, monitoring and user management.

3. Transit Gateway to Power Virtual Server hosting the SAP application and databases 

4. Public connectivity also routes through Cloud Internet Services (CIS) which can provide global load balancing, failover and DDoS services, then routes to the VPC Landing Zone

5. Global Transit Gateway connecting the PowerVS environment across regions to facilitate replication for DR purposes.



Figure 2 illustrates a detailed network and component architecture for a single-zone, multi-region deployment to facilitate disaster recovery.

### Architecture description
{: #architecture-description}

1.	Two separate IBM Cloud regions, one for Primary workload and the other for Disaster Recovery. If Cost Optimized Disaster Recovery is considered, some Non Production systems may share the same compute with Disaster Recovery systems. 
2.	Enterprise network connectivity from On-premise to IBM Cloud is accomplished through Direct Links. 
3.	A VPC Landing Zone (Edge VPC) is deployed which contains routing and security functions.  For security purposes, all ingress and egress traffic will route through the VPC Landing Zone.  It contains a Bastion host (jump), Firewalls providing advanced security functions and the SAP router and SAP Web Dispatcher.  
4.	Besides Power Workloads in Power workspace, x86 workloads may be implemented in a Workload VPC. To backup Power workloads, Secure Automated Backup with Compass by Cobalt Iron is implemented. The private end point for this backup service is located in VPC. 
5.	VPCs are connected to Power workspace through a local Transit Gateway 
6.	Public connectivity routes through Cloud Internet Services which can provide global load balancing, failover, and DDoS services, then routes to the VPC Landing Zone
7.	SAP workloads may be hosted on redundant SAP certified LPARS in PowerVS 
8.	SAP Application and SAP HANA should be placed on SAP certified LPARs within the zone with proximity considered
9.	Virtual Private endpoints in VPCs are used to provide connectivity to cloud native services 
10.	Global Transit Gateway connecting Power workspace across regions for data replication purposes between the two regions.
11.	To achieve 99.95% infrastructure availability, multiple LPARs in the same placement group within a zone can be implemented

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Design decisions that need to be considered for an end-2-end SAP on PowerVS deployment and which are covered in this accelerator include:


- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual Servers
- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, and Archive
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing
- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response
- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration


The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. See Introduction to the Architecture Framework for more details.

## Requirements

The following represents a baseline set of requirements which we believe are applicable to most clients and critical to a successful SAP deployment.

As mentioned earlier, the [Architecture
Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)
is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for
which architecture decisions need to be made based on customer
requirements. The following sections contain the considerations, and
architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are in scope for
this solution pattern.
